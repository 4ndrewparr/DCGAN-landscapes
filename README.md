# DCGAN-landscapes *(work in progress)*

Trained Deep Convolutional GAN that outputs impressionist landscapes.

The architecture of the network is based on the PyTorch implementation from the paper **'Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks'** by Soumith Chintala. https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434

The dataset used for training was scraped from https://www.wikiart.org/. It includes around 1,500 impressionist paintings with landscapes as main theme. The scraper built specifically for the task can be found in the repository.

*I plan to upload the trained model weigths as well as soon as training is complete*
